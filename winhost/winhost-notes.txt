DB2 10.1 and Java 6.0

    *  DB2_ESE_10_Win_x86-64.exe
    *  ibm-java-jre-60-win-x86_64.zip


Chef cookbooks and Vagrant files

1.  Since Vagrant shared folders may not work on Windows guests,
    you may need to check the Virtualbox Devices -> Shared Folders and
    edit the host location as just "vagrant".
    Map \\VBOXSVR\vagrant to Z: drive.

2.  Create C:\cookbooks and C:\vagrant by running ...
    cscript /nologo Z:\Z-Chef.vbs
