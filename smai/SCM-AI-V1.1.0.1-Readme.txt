2.0 Problems fixed
==================
The following problems are addressed by this Fix Pack.

2.1 APARs 
---------
APAR IV39406 
------------    

Error Description:                                              
The EIF event, when generated from a private situation, is normalized for the   
predicate value.  This value is confusing to users because they do not know what 
the scale is.  The predicate should be created non-normalized in the event.     

Local Fix: None.                                                

2.2 Defects 
-------------
Defect: 33139
-------------
Abstract: Changes were made to the central config load list and private situation 
file to address agent restart issues.  

Additional Information:
Depending on agent installation and configurations, there were occasions when 
the agent would not successfully restart after picking up its new configuration 
from the SCM-AI Fabric Node.  This fix supports a new agent function that allows 
the agent to be reconfigured without necessitating an agent restart.

NOTE: Agents that are not at the Fix Pack 1 version will have issues with user 
defined thresholds being deployed from a Fabric Node at Fix Pack 1 level. 
Therefore agents should be updated to the Fix Pack 1 level. 

-------------
Defect: 32464 
-------------

Abstract: In a VMWare environment, the Fabric Node is unable to discover a 
Consumer VM for which the user gets access granted after the installation of SCM-AI. 

A Fabric Node restart is needed in order to have the new Consumer VM recognized 
and added to the SM-AI dashboard.
               
Additional Information:
SCM-AI does its discovery by interrogating the underlying cloud platform. VMWare 
has a restriction whereby the credentials used to interrogate the platform 
are reflected to the users’ VM(s). Therefore, if the credentials supplied to SCM-AI 
in the configuration wizard do not have access rights to all the VMs in the
user’s environment, the VMs that are not authorized will not be 
discovered.  The only way to remedy this is to alter the access rights on 
the user VM, and then restart the Fabric Node. 

Note: none of the other supported provider platforms have this limitation.

--------------
Defect: 203056
--------------
Abstract: Sporadic read time outs are shown in the SCM-AI GUI due to high-volume 
          ASI requests.

Additional Information:
When the agents are overrun with requests, new requests will time out and are 
indicated in the Group Dashboard and the Group Details dashboard by an “Overdue” 
icon in the Group column, and in the log file by corresponding entries. The 
time-out state is temporary in this scenario, and the icon is removed after the 
next successful exchange with the agent in question.  The fix for the high-volume 
ASI requests eliminates the read time outs and the rapid on and off display of the 
“Overdue”indicator.

-------------
Defect 203309 
------------- 
 
Abstract: Sporadic Premature EOF and XMLParseErrors in the SCM-AI GUI, caused by 
missing or incomplete agent response data.

Additional Information:
At certain times, the agent returns incomplete or malformed XML formatted 
Data, which is interpreted as a communications issue by SCM-AI.  The communication 
issue is manifested in the Group Dashboard and the Group Details dashboard by an 
“Overdue” icon in the Group column, as well as corresponding entries in the log 
files. This fix corrects the response XML encoding within the agent.

3.0 Architecture and prerequisites
==================================
This fix is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux for x86_64 platforms for 
version 6.2 and later of the operating system.

Please refer to the SmartCloud Monitoring - Application Insight prerequisites 
documentation for the latest operating system certification information:
https://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v63r1/topic/com.ibm.scmai.doc_1.1/install/scmai_prerequisites.htm

 3.1 Prerequisites for this fix
  --------------------------------         
 Because this fix is cumulative, it can be installed stand alone or used to 
 upgrade an existing SmartCloud Monitoring - Application Insight 1.1 release.

4.0 Image directory contents
============================
This fix contains the following files:
- SCM-AI-V1.1.0.1.Readme.txt - This README file
- SmartCloudMonitoring-ApplicationInsightFabricNodeV1.1.0.1.tar
- SmartCloudMonitoring-ApplicationInsightAgentConsumerVMV1.1.0.1.tar


5.0 Installation instructions 
=============================
If you are installing SmartCloud Monitoring - Application Insight for the 
first time, follow the instructions in the SmartCloud Monitoring - Application 
Insight installation guide located here:

https://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v63r1/topic/com.ibm.scmai.doc_1.1/install/scmai_install.htm

If you have already installed the SCM-AI trial software and want to install or 
upgrade to a new trial version, you will be prompted to accept a new Trial 
license for the installation. If you accept the new Trial license, the previous 
version of the software is uninstalled automatically and the new trial version 
is installed. Any SCM-AI related configuration and customizations will be lost 
unless you have purchased and applied the production license prior to installing 
this Fix Pack. 

If you are upgrading a production environment use the following instructions. 

Upgrade the fabric node from SCMA-AI 1.1 to SCMA-AI 1.1.0.1 using content from this file: 

SmartCloudMonitoring-ApplicationInsightFabricNodeV1.1.0.1.tar

When upgrading a fabric node VM that has SCM-AI version 1.1 already installed, 
follow these steps to complete the upgrade.

 1. Untar the fabric node tarball to a new folder on the target VM where SCM-AI 
    is already installed.
 2. Run the ./install.sh script from the command line prompt and reply to the 
    questions asked.
 3. Clear your browser cache after the "Installation Successful" console message 
    is displayed. Clearing your browser cache helps ensure that you will begin 
    using the updated user interface code installed in the previous step.
 4. Check the content of the About page, which you can open from the (?)->Help 
    menu located at the bottom of the navigation bar in the user interface. 
    The first line of output should display "Version: 1.1.0.1" if the upgrade 
    was completed successfully.

Upgrading SCM-AI packaged Linux System Monitor and Web Response Time agents 
from the customer VM tarball using content from this file:

SmartCloudMonitoring-ApplicationInsightAgentConsumerVMV1.1.0.1.tar

**NOTE:** Do not use the "rpm -U" command to upgrade from the SCM-AI 1.1 version 
ITM agents to the SCM-AI 1.1.0.1 version ITM agents. Instead, use one of the agent 
install scripts outlined in step #3 below.

1. SCM-AI Fix Pack 1 contains improvements to agent behavior for the two ITM agents it delivers. 
   The two updated agents are:
    1. ITM Linux SMA agent, Product code=LZ
    2. ITM Web Response Time agent, Product code=T5
2. The SCMA-AI Fix Pack 1 (1.1.0.1) fabric node will not function properly with the 
   agents from the SCM-AI 1.1 release. Customers should upgrade the SCM-AI version 1.1 
   agents they are using to Fix Pack 1.
3. Upgrading existing SCM-AI version 1.1 agents running on VMs or installing 
   newer 1.1.0.1 SCM-AI agents on VMs without agents can be accomplished by running 
   the appropriate installation script. Which script to use depends on which agents 
   you already have installed or wish to install on your VM. Refer to the chart below 
   for the script to use in each case.

Installed agent    Upgrade or install agent(s)         Run this script
---------------    ---------------------------         ---------------
None               Linux SMA                      ./installSystemMonitorAgent.sh
None               Web Response Time & Linux SMA  ./installWebResponseTime.sh
Linux SMA only     Linux SMA                      ./installSystemMonitorAgent.sh
Web Response Time  Web Response Time & Linux SMA  ./installWebResponseTime.sh
