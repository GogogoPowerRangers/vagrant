win2012core Notes

Windows 2012 Server has a core installation.
This installation lacks most of the Windows GUI tools.
Since we are just installing a basic IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) component (e.g,
Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Automation Server), we do not require all of
these administrative tools. ITM components that require lots of Windows tuning or
configuration are not candidates for the Windows 2012 core installation.


*** Download and Install Windows 2012 Server installation ISO

1.  Evaluation download if you do not have MSDN access.

    [ http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/hh670538.aspx ]

2.  Create Virtual Machine with Virtualbox.

    Use a Virtual Machine name such as win2012core.
    Choose Windows 2012 Server "core" installation.

    Note: VMware was not tried but should work out fine.


*** Basic configuration

1.  Disable firewall since tools are missing.

    netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off

2.  Enable Windows network discovery.

    netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="Network Discovery" new enable=Yes

3.  Disable Windows UAC which can be hard to manage.

    Run regedit and set "0 for
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\system\EnableUA

4.  Disable Windows password complexity rules.

    mkdir C:\temp
    secedit /export /cfg C:\temp\new.cfg
    echo Replace 'PasswordComplexity=1' with 'PasswordComplexity=0'
    notepad C:\temp\new.cfg
    pause
    secedit /configure /db %windir%\security\new.sdb /cfg C:\temp\new.cfg /areas SECURITYPOLICY

5.  Set hostname.

    netdom renamecomputer localhost /newname:win2012core /reboot /force

6.  Create vagrant user.

    net user vagrant vagrant /add
    net localgroup Administrators /add vagrant

7.  [Virtualbox] Install Virtual Box Guest Additions.


*** Vagrant box

1.  Create Vagrant box.

    mkdir vagrant_repo
    cd vagrant_repo
    vagrant init
    vagrant package --base win2012core --output win2012core.box


*** Vagrant

1.  Add Windows ports to Vagrantfile.

    # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
    # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
    # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
    config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 8080
    config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 3389, host: 3389
    config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5985, host: 5985
    config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 1433, host: 1433
    config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 10001, host: 10001

    Note: Take notes if Vagrant uses different ports. For example, port 3389 on
          Windows hosts is probably in use for Remote Desktop services.

2.  You can boot in GUI mode by uncommenting the Vagrantfile.

    vb.gui = true

    Note: It's also possible to use Windows Remote Desktop to connect.

3.  Since there is no GUI to map drives, you will need to use the Windows net command.

    net use * \\VBOXSVR\vagrant
    net use * \\VBOXSVR\vagrant_data
